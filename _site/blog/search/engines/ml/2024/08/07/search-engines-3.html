<p>search engines 3.0</p>

<h2 id="gen-1-eg-google">Gen 1 (e.g., google):</h2>
<p>Traditional search engines where users input a query and receive a list of links to relevant web pages. Users must sift through these links to find the information they need.</p>

<h2 id="gen-2-eg-perplexity">Gen 2 (e.g., perplexity):</h2>
<p>Search engines that provide a summarized answer to a query by analyzing the top links. This approach reduces the time users spend reading through multiple sources, offering concise information directly.</p>

<h2 id="gen-3">gen 3</h2>
<p>Advanced Search engines that not only provide answers but also perform complex reasoning to gather information from multiple sources. These engines might use techniques like natural language understanding, web scraping, and integration of various data points to deliver a precise answer. An example is your given scenario: asking how many essays Paul Graham has written since “hackers &amp; painters” was published. Such a search engine would:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- determine the publication date of "hackers &amp; painters"
- navigate paul graham's website or other relevant sources
- count the essays published since that date
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This progression shows how search engines are becoming more sophisticated in understanding context and providing specific, detailed answers to complex queries.</p>
